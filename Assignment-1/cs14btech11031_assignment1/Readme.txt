The following are the contents of this assignment :

1. Source-code : This folder contains all the source codes for both the parts, and their corresponding ReadMe(s).
2. Report : Report.pdf
3. Graphs : Avg_delay.png and Throughput.png
4. Code for plotting graphs : For getting a graph of throughput and average_delay, run the programs in part-2 folder, bring the
                              output files (output1.txt for throughput and output2.txt for delay) in the same directory as the
                              python codes and do this :

                              python graph_throughput.py -> plots a graph of throughput v/s time-interval of 1 s, and
                              python graph_delay.py -> plots a graph of average_delay v/s time-interval of 1 s.
5. Readme.txt
6. Screenshots : Screenshots showing the working of the codes.
